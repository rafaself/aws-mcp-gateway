# ChatGPT connector smoke validation runbook

Manual end-to-end validation for a deployed AWS MCP Gateway used as a **ChatGPT custom app connector** with `AUTH_MODE=oauth`.

**Start with the production acceptance gate:** [chatgpt-connector-production-acceptance.md](chatgpt-connector-production-acceptance.md) (`pnpm run verify:connector-contract` locally, then the 18-step deployed and ChatGPT checklist). This runbook provides detailed expected responses for each HTTP and UI step.

**Related documentation:**

- [auth-chatgpt-oauth.md](auth-chatgpt-oauth.md) — Auth0 OAuth setup
- [chatgpt-connector-production-acceptance.md](chatgpt-connector-production-acceptance.md) — production acceptance checklist (start here)
- [chatgpt-connector.md](chatgpt-connector.md) — connector overview and discovery model
- [mcp-testing.md](mcp-testing.md) — curl smoke tests (legacy bearer and failure modes)

**Automated pre-checks (optional):** [`scripts/verify-oauth-deployment.sh`](../scripts/verify-oauth-deployment.sh) validates protected resource metadata and the unauthenticated `/mcp` OAuth challenge over HTTP. It does **not** replace ChatGPT UI validation.

Replace `<worker-host>` with your deployed Worker hostname (for example `aws-mcp-gateway.example.workers.dev`). Do not paste real OAuth access tokens, AWS keys, Auth0 client secrets, account IDs, or private callback identifiers into issues, docs, or terminal history.

## URL model

Before running smoke checks, confirm this split:

```text
ChatGPT Connector Server URL: https://<worker-host>/mcp
MCP_RESOURCE_URL and OAUTH_AUDIENCE: https://<worker-host> (origin only — do not append /mcp)
Protected resource metadata: https://<worker-host>/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource
```

`pnpm run verify:oauth` prints the ChatGPT Connector Server URL and validates deployed metadata.

---

## Prerequisites

- Worker deployed with `AUTH_MODE=oauth` and OAuth vars configured (see [auth-chatgpt-oauth.md](auth-chatgpt-oauth.md)).
- AWS secrets (`AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`) configured in Cloudflare.
- Auth0 (or compatible OIDC) application with ChatGPT redirect URI and `aws:read` scope grant.
- ChatGPT account with permission to create custom app connectors.

---

## Step 1 — Verify Worker health

```bash
curl https://<worker-host>/health
```

**Expected:**

- HTTP `200`
- Body: `{ "ok": true, "service": "aws-mcp-gateway" }`

`/health` is public and must not expose credentials, tokens, or AWS configuration.

---

## Step 2 — Verify protected resource metadata

```bash
curl https://<worker-host>/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource
```

**Expected:**

- HTTP `200`
- JSON includes:
  - `resource` — Worker URL (for example `https://<worker-host>`)
  - `authorization_servers` — array with your OIDC issuer URL
  - `scopes_supported` — includes `aws:read`
  - `resource_documentation` — link to this repository

This route works without AWS credentials. It must not expose JWT claims, JWKS material, or provider error bodies.

---

## Step 3 — Verify unauthenticated `/mcp` returns OAuth challenge

```bash
curl -i -X POST https://<worker-host>/mcp \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"tools/list"}'
```

**Expected:**

- HTTP `401`
- `WWW-Authenticate` header contains:
  - `Bearer`
  - `resource_metadata=` (pointing at `/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource`)
  - `scope=` (includes `aws:read`)
  - `error="invalid_token"`
- JSON body uses normalized `unauthorized` error — not raw stack traces or binding names.

Unauthenticated requests must never reach MCP tool execution.

---

## Step 4 — Validate authenticated `tools/list`

Before relying on the ChatGPT Actions UI, confirm the deployed gateway returns all public tools with valid descriptors.

Obtain an OAuth access token through the ChatGPT connector flow (or your OIDC provider's token endpoint for staging). Do **not** paste tokens into docs, issues, or terminal history.

```bash
curl -X POST https://<worker-host>/mcp \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <oauth-access-token>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"tools/list","params":{}}'
```

Example JSON-RPC payload (no token required in the body):

```json
{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"tools/list","params":{}}
```

**Expected:**

- HTTP `200`
- `result.tools` includes all **8** public tools:
  - `search`
  - `fetch`
  - `get_gateway_status`
  - `get_aws_cost_summary`
  - `get_aws_cost_by_service`
  - `list_ec2_instances`
  - `get_cloudwatch_alarms`
  - `get_recent_log_errors`
- Each tool descriptor includes `name`, `title`, `description`, `inputSchema`, OAuth `securitySchemes`, and read-only annotations.

If `tools/list` is empty or descriptors are missing required fields, OAuth may still succeed while ChatGPT shows **“No app actions available yet”**. Fix descriptors and redeploy before troubleshooting in the ChatGPT UI.

For local `AUTH_MODE=legacy-bearer` smoke tests, replace the bearer token with `MCP_AUTH_TOKEN`. See [mcp-testing.md](mcp-testing.md).

---

## Step 5 — Create or refresh the ChatGPT custom app connector

1. In ChatGPT → **Settings → Apps → Create** (or edit an existing connector).
2. Set **Server URL** to `https://<worker-host>/mcp`.
3. Set **Authentication** to **OAuth**.
4. If updating an existing connector after a gateway deploy, click **Refresh** so ChatGPT reloads `tools/list`.

Full Auth0 setup: [auth-chatgpt-oauth.md](auth-chatgpt-oauth.md).

---

## Step 6 — Complete OAuth login in ChatGPT

1. Start the connector OAuth flow in ChatGPT.
2. Log in with your Auth0 (or OIDC) user — not your ChatGPT account credentials.
3. Approve access if prompted.

**Expected:** OAuth callback completes without redirect URI errors.

---

## Step 7 — Confirm ChatGPT Actions are visible

After OAuth succeeds, open the connector and confirm **Actions** lists AWS tools.

**Expected:** Tools such as `search`, `fetch`, `get_gateway_status`, and AWS read-only tools appear. You should **not** see “No app actions available yet” if the deployed gateway returns valid OAuth-backed `tools/list` descriptors for all public tools.

If Actions are empty but Step 4 passed, refresh the connector (Step 5) and verify ChatGPT is not serving a stale connector cache.

---

## Step 8 — Call `get_gateway_status` (first live connector call)

Ask ChatGPT to check gateway status, or invoke `get_gateway_status` through the connector.

**Expected:**

- Tool succeeds without calling AWS.
- Response reports gateway mode (read-only) and does not expose AWS credentials, bearer tokens, or secrets.

Use this as the **first** live connector call because it validates OAuth and MCP execution without depending on AWS IAM or regional inventory.

---

## Step 9 — Use `search` for an AWS capability

Ask ChatGPT to find a tool, for example: “search for EC2 instances” or “find cost tools.”

**Expected:**

- `search` returns catalog document ids with the `tool/` prefix (for example `tool/list_ec2_instances`).
- No AWS API calls occur during search.

---

## Step 10 — Use `fetch` for one returned catalog id

Ask ChatGPT to fetch details for one id from Step 9 (for example `tool/list_ec2_instances`).

**Expected:**

- `fetch` returns a document describing the tool, its inputs, and read-only behavior.
- No live AWS data in the fetch response.

---

## Step 11 — Call one bounded read-only AWS tool

Ask ChatGPT to list EC2 instances in **one allowed region** from your `AWS_ALLOWED_REGIONS` configuration.

**Preferred smoke tool:** `list_ec2_instances` with a single region (for example `us-east-1`).

**Expected:**

- Tool returns normalized read-only EC2 inventory or an empty list.
- Response does not include raw AWS JSON or credentials.

Do **not** use CloudWatch Logs as the first AWS smoke test — log groups are account-specific and more likely to produce false negatives.

---

## Step 12 — Verify safe failure behavior

Confirm failures are normalized and do not leak secrets:

| Scenario | How to trigger | Expected |
|----------|----------------|----------|
| Missing scope | Auth0 client without `aws:read` grant | `forbidden` or `unauthorized`; no AWS data |
| Disallowed region | Request a region outside `AWS_ALLOWED_REGIONS` | `validation_error` before AWS call |
| Invalid AWS config | Temporarily misconfigure secrets (staging only) | `configuration_error` or `aws_error` — no raw AWS bodies or keys |

Never paste OAuth access tokens into troubleshooting notes or GitHub issues.

---

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Likely cause | Required fix |
|---------|--------------|--------------|
| OAuth callback fails | Redirect URI mismatch | Copy the exact ChatGPT callback URI into Auth0 and rerun setup |
| OAuth succeeds but no actions are visible | `tools/list` empty, invalid descriptors, stale connector cache, or wrong deployed commit | Run `/mcp` `tools/list` check, refresh/recreate connector, verify deploy |
| OAuth works but tool calls fail unauthorized | Missing/invalid access token | Re-link connector and verify OAuth challenge metadata |
| Tool calls fail forbidden | Token lacks `aws:read` | Fix Auth0 API/client scope grant |
| ChatGPT connector setup fails | Server URL does not include `/mcp` | Use `https://<worker-host>/mcp` in ChatGPT |
| Metadata discovery fails | `MCP_RESOURCE_URL` incorrectly includes `/mcp` | Use origin only for `MCP_RESOURCE_URL` and `OAUTH_AUDIENCE` |
| AWS tool fails after actions appear | IAM, region allowlist, or AWS secret issue | Verify AWS config and use `get_gateway_status` first |
| ChatGPT sees old tool descriptors | Cached connector metadata | Refresh connector after deployment |

---

## Security reminders

- Do not paste OAuth access tokens, AWS keys, Cloudflare API tokens, or Auth0 client secrets into docs, issues, or screenshots.
- `/mcp` must never accept unauthenticated requests.
- This gateway is read-only — no write or management AWS tools in the MVP.
- Do not widen IAM permissions for smoke testing.
